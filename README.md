# Perceptron-Branch-Predictor-
Branch Prediction in microarchitecture level using single layer perceptron in SimpleScalar

The branch predictors like 2-level and bimodal have relatively lesser accuracy compared to a nerual based branch predictor. Hence we use th SimpleScalar tool to implement a perceptron algorithm to increase the accuracy of the branch predictions of the programs. 

The file bpred.c is changed accordingly to accomodate the perceptron predictor also. The arguments while running the SimpleScalar simulation are used to switch between the different types of predictors to see the accuracy.
